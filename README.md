**A menu-bar daemon that drives the cursor, clicks, scrolls, and gestures straight from `hjkl` — modal, count-aware, mark- and register-backed. You never left Vim; now your mouse hasn't either.**

## How it works

`neomouse` is a SwiftUI macOS app that installs a global `CGEventTap` to intercept keyboard events and translate Vim motions into mouse movements, clicks, scrolls, and gestures. It lives in the menu bar (no Dock icon, mode-colored status icon) and runs in the background.

The interaction model is mode-based, mirroring Vim:

- **normal** — hjkl moves the cursor; counts (`5j`), motions (`gg`/`G`/`0`/`$`), `s` snaps to the nearest ruler cell, capital `H`/`J`/`K`/`L` scrolls, `Ctrl-w` + `hjkl` jumps between displays, `m{a-z}` sets a mark, `'{a-z}`/`` `{a-z} `` jumps back, `"{reg}` selects a register, `?` shows the help dialog.
- **find** — a labelled grid overlay covers the screen; one or two keypresses warps the cursor to a cell.
- **specialFind** — a small grid pops up *around the current cursor*; a single keypress lands it on the picked cell. `q`/`w`/`e`/`r` nudge ±10 pts.
- **visual** — `v` enters visual mode; movement extends a highlighted region. `y` yanks (screenshot via `ScreenCaptureKit`), pasteboard-aware register flow (`"ay`, `"ap`, …) round-trips real `NSPasteboardItem`s.
- **command** — `:` opens a command-line overlay with fuzzy-filtered suggestions (`numbers`, `relativenumbers`, `delmarks`, `restart`, …); `Tab`/`Shift-Tab` and `Ctrl-n`/`Ctrl-p` cycle hits.
- **menu** — marks browser and Pasty-style register browser, both keyboard-navigable.
- **disabled** — tap is in `.listenOnly`; every keypress passes straight to the focused app.

The codebase is a multi-target SwiftPM package: a thin `neomouse` executable that owns the app shell and overlays, plus four libraries — `neomouseUtils` (input / screen / pasteboard / gesture / zoom / screenshot / motion helpers, each grouped into a `Mouse` / `Screen` / `Pasteboard` / `Gesture` / `Zoom` / `System` namespace), `neomouseDB` ([GRDB](https://github.com/groue/GRDB.swift)-backed sessions, marks, registers, macros, jumps, and executed-operation store), `neomouseConfig` ([TOMLDecoder](https://github.com/dduan/TOMLDecoder)-backed runtime configuration), and `neomouseTypes` (shared value types — `NeomouseType.Mode`, `.Direction`, `.VisualState`, etc.). Runtime tuning lives in `settings.toml`, validated against `schema/settings.schema.json`.

Tested on macOS 14+ with up to 3 displays. Mouse, gesture, and clipboard event synthesis is wired through `.cgSessionEventTap` + `CGWarpMouseCursorPosition` so it keeps working under macOS Accessibility Zoom.

## Requirements

- **macOS 14 (Sonoma) or later** — visual-mode screen capture uses `ScreenCaptureKit`, which raises the floor from macOS 13 to 14.
- **Apple Silicon (arm64) and Intel (x86_64).** Shipped as a universal binary, so it runs natively on both.
- **Accessibility permissions** — granted on first run. macOS prompts you; allow `neomouse` in **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility**, then relaunch.

The release binary is ad-hoc signed (not Apple Developer ID signed). The Homebrew and Nix install paths handle this transparently; the manual-download path needs one extra command to clear the Gatekeeper quarantine — see below.

## Install

Pick one. All three install the same v0.0.1 binary from the [Releases page](https://github.com/KangaZero/neomouse/releases).

### 1. Homebrew

*The no-Nix, no-fuss path — `brew` handles the ad-hoc signature and puts `neomouse` on your `PATH`.*

```sh
brew tap KangaZero/neomouse
brew install neomouse
```

Then run:

```sh
neomouse
```

Update later with `brew upgrade neomouse`. Uninstall with `brew uninstall neomouse && brew untap KangaZero/neomouse`.

> If your Homebrew is managed declaratively by [`nix-homebrew`](https://github.com/zhaofengli/nix-homebrew), add `github:KangaZero/homebrew-neomouse` as a flake input and put `"neomouse"` in your `homebrew.brews` list. (`brew tap` will not work on a Nix-managed `/opt/homebrew`.)

### 2. Nix

Works on both Apple Silicon (`aarch64-darwin`) and Intel (`x86_64-darwin`). Requires Nix with [flakes enabled](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes#Enable_flakes_temporarily) (`experimental-features = nix-command flakes` in `~/.config/nix/nix.conf`).

**Try it once without installing anything:**

```sh
nix run github:KangaZero/neomouse
```

This downloads the prebuilt binary into your Nix store, runs it, and leaves no trace on next garbage collection.

**Install into your user profile** (puts `neomouse` on your `PATH` permanently — the imperative path):

```sh
nix profile add github:KangaZero/neomouse
```

> If your whole system is already a flake and you're reaching for `nix profile add` anyway — respectfully, you're a bit of a sadist. The declarative **system-flake path below** is the clean way. But this works, and we don't judge (much).

> On Nix older than 2.20, the subcommand is `nix profile install` instead of `add`. Both still work in recent versions, but `install` is now a deprecated alias.

Update later with `nix profile upgrade neomouse`, or `nix profile upgrade --all`. Remove with `nix profile remove neomouse`.

**Add to your system flake** (recommended if you use `nix-darwin`, NixOS, or `home-manager`):

```nix
# In your existing flake.nix, add the input:
{
  inputs.neomouse = {
    url = "github:KangaZero/neomouse";
    inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
  };

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, neomouse, ... }: {
    # ...your existing config...
  };
}
```

Then reference the package wherever you list packages. Using `${pkgs.system}` selects the right output automatically on both Apple Silicon (`aarch64-darwin`) and Intel (`x86_64-darwin`) — e.g. inside your nix-darwin module:

```nix
environment.systemPackages = [
  neomouse.packages.${pkgs.system}.default
];
```

…or inside home-manager:

```nix
home.packages = [
  neomouse.packages.${pkgs.system}.default
];
```

> If `pkgs.system` isn't in scope, hard-code your platform: `aarch64-darwin` on Apple Silicon, `x86_64-darwin` on Intel.

Rebuild your system (`darwin-rebuild switch --flake .#<host>` or `home-manager switch --flake .#<user>`). Pick up new releases with `nix flake update neomouse` and rebuild.

### 3. Manual (download a tarball)

```sh
# Pick the latest release URL from https://github.com/KangaZero/neomouse/releases
VERSION=v0.0.1
curl -LO "https://github.com/KangaZero/neomouse/releases/download/${VERSION}/neomouse-${VERSION}-macos-universal.tar.gz"
curl -LO "https://github.com/KangaZero/neomouse/releases/download/${VERSION}/neomouse-${VERSION}-macos-universal.tar.gz.sha256"

# Verify the download
shasum -a 256 -c "neomouse-${VERSION}-macos-universal.tar.gz.sha256"

# Extract — produces neomouse.app/ in the current directory
tar -xzf "neomouse-${VERSION}-macos-universal.tar.gz"

# Clear macOS download quarantine (only needed on the manual path)
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine ./neomouse.app

# Launch — any of these works:
open ./neomouse.app                       # standard
./neomouse.app/Contents/MacOS/neomouse    # keeps stdout in your terminal
# …or double-click neomouse.app in Finder.

# Optional: move to /Applications, and symlink the inner binary onto PATH
mv ./neomouse.app /Applications/
sudo ln -sf /Applications/neomouse.app/Contents/MacOS/neomouse /usr/local/bin/neomouse
```

On first launch, neomouse copies the bundled default `settings.toml` (shipped at `neomouse.app/Contents/Resources/settings.toml`) to `~/.config/neomouse/settings.toml` if no file is already there. Edit that file to customize. The auto-deploy never overwrites an existing config — your customizations are safe across re-installs.

> Why a `.app` bundle and not a bare binary: SwiftUI's `MenuBarExtra` status item only registers when LaunchServices can read `CFBundleIdentifier` from `.app/Contents/Info.plist`. A bare-binary install would launch the daemon but show no menu-bar icon.

## Development

Requires Swift 6.3+ (`swift --version`). No Xcode required for building — Command Line Tools is enough. [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just) is the front door for every common task; underlying `swift` commands are documented below if you'd rather invoke them directly.

### Tools

Everything the dev workflow touches. The recommended path is the Nix devShell (via [direnv](https://direnv.net/)) for the tooling, plus `swiftly` for the Swift toolchain — Swift is **not** in the dev shell (it comes from full Xcode or swiftly). See the Setup section below.

| Tool | Why it's needed | How you get it |
|---|---|---|
| [Swift](https://www.swift.org/install/) 6.3+ | Compiler / `swift build` / `swift test` / `swift-format` (bundled). | [swiftly](https://www.swift.org/swiftly/documentation/swiftly/) (recommended — respects `.swift-version`), the swift.org installer, or full Xcode. **Not** Command Line Tools alone: its `Testing.framework` is missing `_TestingInterop`, which `swift test` hard-links. **Not provided by the Nix dev shell.** |
| [just](https://github.com/casey/just) | Task runner — every common workflow is a `just <recipe>`. | Nix devShell |
| [taplo](https://taplo.tamasfe.dev/) | TOML linter for `just check-config` (validates `settings.toml` against the schema). | Nix devShell |
| [shellcheck](https://www.shellcheck.net/) | Lints the shell scripts under `scripts/` and `.githooks/`. | Nix devShell |
| [actionlint](https://github.com/rhysd/actionlint) | Lints the GitHub Actions workflows under `.github/workflows/`. | Nix devShell |
| [nixfmt](https://github.com/NixOS/nixfmt) | Formats `flake.nix`. | Nix devShell |
| [statix](https://github.com/oppiliappan/statix) | Lints `flake.nix` for Nix anti-patterns. | Nix devShell |
| [deadnix](https://github.com/astro/deadnix) | Finds dead code in `flake.nix`. | Nix devShell |
| [swiftly](https://www.swift.org/swiftly/documentation/swiftly/) *(recommended)* | Swift toolchain manager; ships the full `xctoolchain` bundle that `sourcekit-lsp` and `swift-testing` need. | `curl -O https://download.swift.org/swiftly/darwin/swiftly.pkg && installer -pkg swiftly.pkg -target CurrentUserHomeDirectory` (see swiftly docs) |
| git | Repo + pre-commit hook (the dev shell points `core.hooksPath` at `.githooks/`). | Comes with Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`). |

`swift-format`, `swift-testing`, and `sourcekit-lsp` all ship inside the Swift toolchain — no separate install. Everything marked "Nix devShell" is provided by `devShells.default` in `flake.nix`; you never install those by hand.

### Setup

```sh
git clone https://github.com/KangaZero/neomouse
cd neomouse

# One-time: allow the repo's .envrc (contains `use flake`)
direnv allow
```

The repo ships a `.envrc` containing `use flake`. Once you run `direnv allow`, the Nix dev shell auto-loads every time you `cd` into the repo — putting `just`, `taplo`, `shellcheck`, `actionlint`, `nixfmt`, `statix`, and `deadnix` on your `PATH`, scoped to this directory. Leave the directory and none of them leak into your global environment. If you'd rather not use direnv, run `nix develop` manually to drop into the same shell.

Entering the dev shell also activates the git hooks: the flake's `shellHook` sets `core.hooksPath=.githooks`, so there's no separate hook-setup step. The pre-commit hook runs `swift format lint --strict` on staged Swift files and `swift test` before each commit; the same checks run in CI on every push to `main` and every PR.

Swift itself is **not** in the dev shell — install it via [swiftly](https://www.swift.org/swiftly/documentation/swiftly/) (see Tools table above) or full Xcode.

> Why swiftly and not Command Line Tools: macOS's CLT toolchain ships `Testing.framework` without the `_TestingInterop` C bridge that `swift-testing` 6.3 hard-links. The swift.org toolchain (what swiftly installs) ships both, so `swift test` works without any rpath gymnastics. Full Xcode also works.

### `just` — the catch-all

```sh
just               # list every recipe with a one-line description
just all           # catch-all: lint + test + release build (what CI runs)
```

Other recipes:

| Recipe | Does |
|---|---|
| `just build` | Debug build → `.build/debug/neomouse` |
| `just release` | Release build → `.build/release/neomouse` |
| `just run` | Build, assemble `.build/debug/neomouse.app` wrapper, run the binary from inside it |
| `just run-release` | Same, for the release config |
| `just test` | Run the test suite (`swift test`) |
| `just lint` | `swift format lint --strict` on `Sources/` and `Tests/` |
| `just fmt` | `swift format -i` to auto-format in place |
| `just check-config` | Validate `settings.toml` against `schema/settings.schema.json` (Taplo) |
| `just check` | `lint + test + check-config` (what the pre-commit hook runs) |
| `just init` | Install the repo-root `settings.toml` to `~/.config/neomouse/settings.toml` (overwrites — for resetting to defaults) |
| `just release-local [version]` | Dry-run the full release pipeline locally **and** install the freshly-built bundle to `/Applications/NeoMouseTest.app` for TCC-stable testing. Default version `v0.0.0-local` |
| `just release-test` | Back-compat alias for `release-local` |
| `just clean` | `swift package clean` and remove `.build/` |

macOS will prompt for Accessibility permissions the first time you launch from each build path. Allow `neomouse` in **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility**, then relaunch.

### Underlying commands

The justfile is a thin wrapper. If you want to run things by hand:

```sh
swift build                  # debug build (binary only, no .app wrapper)
swift build -c release       # release build (binary only, no .app wrapper)
swift run                    # build + run debug — but see caveat below
swift run -c release         # build + run release — same caveat
swift test                   # run the test suite
```

> **Heads up:** `swift run` launches the bare Mach-O at `.build/<config>/neomouse` directly. macOS LaunchServices only reads `CFBundleIdentifier` from a real `.app/Contents/Info.plist` — embedding the same plist in the binary's `__TEXT,__info_plist` section is not enough — so SwiftUI's `MenuBarExtra` silently fails to register a status item. `just run` works around this by assembling `.build/<config>/neomouse.app` from the repo-root `Info.plist` and launching the inner binary from inside that bundle. **If you're working on anything menu-bar-related, use `just run` (or hand-assemble the wrapper yourself), not `swift run`.**

`swift test` uses [swift-testing](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-testing) (`import Testing`). With the swiftly-managed swift.org toolchain (or full Xcode), it Just Works — both `Testing` and `_TestingInterop` ship in the toolchain. If you're stuck on a Command Line Tools-only install, `_TestingInterop` is missing and the link step will fail; install full Xcode or the swift.org toolchain via swiftly.

### Configuration

Runtime tuning is in `settings.toml`. `Config.loadConfig` is called once at app start; properties on `NeoMouseState` fall back to inline defaults when no settings file is resolved. Resolution order (first match wins):

1. `$NEOMOUSE_CONFIG`
2. `~/.config/neomouse/settings.toml`
3. `~/Library/Application Support/neomouse/settings.toml`

The repo-root `settings.toml` is a **template**, not auto-loaded. For local dev, either symlink it (`ln -s "$(pwd)/settings.toml" ~/.config/neomouse/settings.toml`) or `export NEOMOUSE_CONFIG="$(pwd)/settings.toml"`.

Sections (full schema in `schema/settings.schema.json`):

- `[grid]` — find-mode overlay: `divisions`, `inner_divisions`, `inset`, the per-cell label alphabets, `is_always_show_inner_characters`.
- `[motion]` — `rows_on_screen` / `columns_on_screen` (integer or `"automatic"` to derive from screen size; auto keeps cells square), `is_clamp_cursor_to_current_screen`.
- `[visual]` — `minimum_highlight_width`.
- `[gesture]` — pinch/zoom `zoom_step_value`, scroll `increments_per_gesture`, rotate `degrees_to_rotate`.
- `[commands]` — whitelisted command-line commands the user can invoke via `:`.
- `[configuration]` — `is_disable_key_input` (swallow plain-key presses when active vs. listen-only), `max_session_count`, `new_session_on_open`, `mode_on_start` (`"disabled"` / `"normal"` / `"find"` / `"command"` / `"menu"`), `is_show_key_cast` (vim-showcmd pill), `is_auto_snap` (when `:cursorline` / `:cursorcolumn` is active, `hjkl` snaps the cursor to its grid-cell centre so it lines up with the highlighted band; default `false`).
- `[theme.*]` — per-element visual overrides for every overlay except the menu-bar icon. Nine sub-sections: `theme.grid` (shared by find-mode grid + cursor-surrounded grid), `theme.numbers_overlay` (incl. gutter `direction` left/right and `column_strip_direction` top/bottom), `theme.command_line`, `theme.marks_menu`, `theme.register_menu`, `theme.help_dialog`, `theme.visual_highlight`, `theme.toast`, `theme.key_cast`. Every field has a default; the deployed `settings.toml` lists each one with its current value as a starting point. Colors are hex strings (`#rrggbb` / `#rrggbbaa`), fonts are inline tables (`{ family, size, weight, design }`), anchors / materials / directions are string enums. Schema rejects unknown keys ("unknown key(s) in [theme.toast]: `backgrond`. Valid keys: …") and unknown enum values ("unknown direction value `leftt`; expected one of: left, right") at decode time, surfaced via a toast.

`just check-config` runs Taplo against `schema/settings.schema.json` so schema drift is caught at commit time, not at startup.

### Customization at runtime

Two complementary paths for tweaking `settings.toml` without restarting:

- **Hot reload.** `SettingsWatcher` watches the resolved `settings.toml` for writes (debounced ~250 ms, atomic-save aware). On every successful re-decode, the new theme republishes into `NeoMouseState.theme` (`@Published`) and every SwiftUI view that reads `state.theme.X` redraws automatically. Decode failures keep the previous theme in place and surface the error via a toast — including the "unknown key" / "unknown value" hints from the strict validator above. Edit `~/.config/neomouse/settings.toml` in any editor; changes land in the live app within the debounce window.
- **Settings window.** Menu-bar dropdown → **Settings…** (or `⌘,` when neomouse is the focused app) opens an Apple-style preferences window with a sidebar listing a **Behavior** section plus each themable element. Every control is native: `ColorPicker` (with opacity slider in the system color panel) for colors, `Stepper` for numbers, `Picker` for enums, `Toggle` for behavior knobs, free-text + dropdowns for the single shared font family / weight / design. Theme edits apply **live** (no Apply button) by writing into `state.theme` — drag a stepper, the overlay resizes mid-drag. **Save** (`⌘S`) persists the live theme to `~/.config/neomouse/settings.toml` (via `ThemeWriter`, preserving every non-`[theme.*]` section above it byte-for-byte) and the Behavior toggles into `[configuration]` (via `ConfigWriter`, a line-level rewrite). **Reset to Defaults** reverts the live theme and behavior knobs to the built-in values. While Settings is open, neomouse is force-paused (mode → `.disabled`) so the panel doesn't fight live overlays for the cursor; re-enable with `⌘E` after closing — `is_auto_snap` takes effect on the next `hjkl` motion.

A live regression script — `scripts/test-hot-reload.sh` (pass `--launch` to first build + install `/Applications/NeoMouseTest.app`) — drives `~/.config/neomouse/settings.toml` through eight mutation scenarios (valid + invalid + revert) and tails `~/Library/Logs/neomouse/neomouse.log` to confirm the watcher reacted as expected.

### Dev seed

The DB starts with a single seed session ("Cookiezi"). To reinitialise from scratch with extra sessions and randomly-placed marks (useful when exercising mark UX), set `NEOMOUSE_SEED=1`:

```sh
NEOMOUSE_SEED=1 swift run
```

This **wipes and re-creates every table** (`forceReIntialize: true`), then runs `seedAll(sessionCount: 3, marksPerSession: 5, registersPerSession: 3)` — extra sessions, randomly-placed marks, and registers `a`–`c` populated with sample `NSPasteboardItem`s. Do not set this on a database you care about.

### Debug logging

`debug(...)` in `Sources/neomouseUtils/dev/debug.swift` writes to two independent sinks: **stdout** and **a log file**. Each is gated separately.

**Stdout** is enabled when either:

- The binary was built in debug configuration (`swift build` / `swift run`), so `#if DEBUG` is set automatically, **or**
- The runtime env var `DEBUG` is set to a non-empty, non-falsy value (anything except `0` / `false`).

```sh
DEBUG=1 neomouse              # installed via brew/nix
DEBUG=1 swift run -c release  # locally built release binary
```

Debug builds always print to stdout regardless of the env var.

**File logging** is enabled when *either* of these is true:

- `LOG` env var is non-empty / non-falsy (explicit opt-in — primarily a dev override), **or**
- The process is running from a bundled `.app` (i.e. `Bundle.main.bundleIdentifier` is set — `just run`, brew install, nix run, manual `.app` extraction). Set `LOG=0` (or `false`) to opt back out in that case.

This means **users running the release `.app` get a log file by default** — no env-var dance — and the menu-bar **Diagnostics → Show Debug Log** / **Reveal Log in Finder** items open it for them.

**Destination** (first match):

1. `$LOG_LOCATION` — full file path if it ends in `.log`, else dir + `neomouse.log`.
2. `~/Library/Logs/neomouse/neomouse.log` — when running from a bundle. Standard Apple location; opens directly in Console.app.
3. `/tmp/neomouse/logs/neomouse.log` — legacy fallback (LOG=1 set, no LOG_LOCATION, bare `swift run`).

```sh
# Bundled install (brew/nix/manual .app/`just run`): log file is on by default.
# Disable explicitly:
LOG=0 neomouse

# Override the destination:
LOG_LOCATION=~/scratch/nm.log neomouse
LOG_LOCATION=/tmp/x neomouse           # → /tmp/x/neomouse.log

# Bare `swift run` (no bundle): logs to stdout only unless you opt in
LOG=1 swift run                        # → /tmp/neomouse/logs/neomouse.log
LOG=1 LOG_LOCATION=~/scratch/nm.log swift run
DEBUG=1 LOG=1 swift run                # both stdout and file
```

The env-var + bundle checks are evaluated once at module load, so per-`debug()` overhead is a `Bool` check plus formatting. File writes are serialized on a background queue.

### Lint / format config

`.swift-format` at the repo root: 4-space indent, 120-line limit, `NoAssignmentInExpressions` disabled (the codebase intentionally uses `return state = ...`).
