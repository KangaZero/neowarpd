# Dry-run the full release pipeline LOCALLY *and* install the freshly-built
# bundle to `/Applications/NeoMouseTest.app` so you can test against a real,
# TCC-stable install. Two phases:
#
#   1. Same artifacts `scripts/release.sh` would produce: a universal
#      (arm64 + x86_64) release build, ad-hoc-signed `neomouse.app` bundle inside
#      `dist/neomouse-<version>-macos-universal.tar.gz` plus its `.sha256`. Stops
#      short of anything that touches a remote (no git tag, no `gh release
#      create`, no Homebrew tap update, no flake bump).
#
#   2. Replace `/Applications/NeoMouseTest.app` with the freshly-built bundle,
#      rewriting bundle identity so TCC tracks the test install separately
#      from a future production NeoMouse:
#        CFBundleIdentifier:  com.kangazero.NeoMouseTest  (≠ production)
#        CFBundleName / DisplayName: NeoMouseTest         (≠ "NeoMouse")
#      Re-signs after the plist edit (--deep, ad-hoc) and clears quarantine.
#      `/Applications/` is the only stable path TCC reliably honors — `/tmp/`
#      and `.build/` paths get a fresh TCC identity each rebuild and macOS
#      sometimes refuses to add them via System Settings → Privacy → Input
#      Monitoring → "+". Putting the test bundle in /Applications means
#      granting Accessibility + Input Monitoring once carries across every
#      subsequent `just release-local`.
#
# After the first launch, grant once:
#   System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility    → enable NeoMouseTest
#   System Settings → Privacy & Security → Input Monitoring → enable NeoMouseTest
# Subsequent runs replace the bundle in place; TCC keeps both grants.
#
# Usage: `just release-local` (uses v0.0.0-local) or `just release-local v0.0.1-rc1`.
