  # Universal binary (arm64 + x86_64) — no `depends_on arch:` constraint, runs
  # natively on both Apple Silicon and Intel Macs.
  depends_on macos: :sonoma

  # The release tarball now ships a `neomouse.app` bundle (not a bare binary)
  # because SwiftUI's MenuBarExtra status item only registers when
  # LaunchServices can read CFBundleIdentifier from .app/Contents/Info.plist.
  # We install the bundle under the prefix and symlink the inner binary onto
  # PATH so `neomouse` still works as a CLI invocation.
  def install
    prefix.install "neomouse.app"
    bin.install_symlink prefix/"neomouse.app/Contents/MacOS/neomouse"

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      neomouse is a menu-bar daemon. The .app bundle is installed at:
        #{opt_prefix}/neomouse.app

      Launch options (any of these works):
        neomouse                                    # via the PATH symlink
        open #{opt_prefix}/neomouse.app
        #{opt_prefix}/neomouse.app/Contents/MacOS/neomouse

      First launch:
        - macOS will prompt for Accessibility permissions. Allow `neomouse` in
          System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility, then relaunch.
        - The bundled default `settings.toml` is copied to
          ~/.config/neomouse/settings.toml (only if no file is already there).
          Edit that file to customize; the deploy never overwrites your config.
